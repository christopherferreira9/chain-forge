    # ed25519-dalek 1.0.1 - Double Public Key Signing Function Oracle Attack
    # REASON: This comes from Solana SDK 2.x which still uses ed25519-dalek 1.x internally.
    # Forcing ed25519-dalek 2.x breaks compatibility with Solana.
    # This will be resolved when Solana SDK updates to ed25519-dalek 2.x.
    # NOT a concern for local development tool - this attack requires specific misuse patterns.
