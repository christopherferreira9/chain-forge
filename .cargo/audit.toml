    # ed25519-dalek 1.0.1 - Double Public Key Signing Function Oracle Attack
    # REASON: This comes from Solana SDK 2.x which still uses ed25519-dalek 1.x internally.
    # Forcing ed25519-dalek 2.x breaks compatibility with Solana.
    # This will be resolved when Solana SDK updates to ed25519-dalek 2.x.
    # NOT a concern for local development tool - this attack requires specific misuse patterns.
    "RUSTSEC-2022-0093",

    # curve25519-dalek 3.2.0 - Timing variability in Scalar29::sub/Scalar52::sub
    # REASON: Transitive dependency from ed25519-dalek 1.0.1 (see above).
    # Cannot patch to 4.1.3+ without breaking Solana SDK compatibility.
    # Will be resolved when Solana migrates to ed25519-dalek 2.x.
    # Timing attacks are not a concern for local development validator.
    "RUSTSEC-2024-0344",

    # atty 0.2.14 - Potential unaligned read
    # REASON: From Solana's env_logger, used only for terminal detection.
    # Low severity, only affects specific architectures, no security impact for this tool.
